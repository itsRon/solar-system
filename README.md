# solar-system
This repository contains a website develop with HTML and CSS about the Solar System and its planets.

I developed this website for a final school year project. My teacher asked the class to develop a website with HTML and CSS tag and properties we analized during this school year. He asked us to create a website about a topic we like or something we are interest in. 
I decided to develop this site about the solar system because I always had an interest in space and space esploration. The website's language is in italian because the website will be showed to my class and teachers, so I writed all the text in italian for a better accessibility.
I hope you will like this projects, if you will please consider to leave a star.
